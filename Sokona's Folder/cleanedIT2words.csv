easter eggs,4,JEDI,"no. 27 - ""We note that this activity used Easter eggs for convenience and economy. Instructors will need to be sensitive about the association of Easter eggs with a Christian holiday, and that a religious reference may exclude some students. Alternatives to Easter eggs include plastic food bags, sewing kits, ring boxes, or change purses. We found no evidence that our students connected the use of Easter eggs to promotion of a Christian holiday. In our class, students reacted positively to the brightly colored eggs and the opportunity to eat leftover candy""",

congenital heart,3,JEDI,"no. 171 - ""As we explore and discuss the cross-cultural dimensions and ethics on congenital heart defects in the greater Yakima Valley, we link the affective learning dimensions and explore in-depth the process of the molecular and cellular process of developmental biology. For example, before I began discussions on Cre/LoxP and fate mapping experiments, I engaged students in a community classroom discussion on articles that highlight emerging incidences of congenital heart diseases in the homeland of Yakama Nation, as well as the greater Yakima Valley of Washington State. Upon reading these articles, students explored how topics discussed in heart development and Cre/LoxP research in zebrafish heart cell lineages are linked to providing future insights into congenital heart diseases.

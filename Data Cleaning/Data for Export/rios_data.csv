Diversifying and Humanizing Scientist Role Models Through Interviews and Constructing Slide Decks on Researchers’ Research and Life Experiences,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.1,Lesson,2022,"proffessional development and career planning, science process skills","research, diversity, inclusion, Scientific Process, Representation, Scientist, Role Models",yes,"this lesson was designed to both introduce (or reintroduce) students to the importance of diversity in science, as well as to help students humanize researchers for themselves. we used active learning to make the teaching and classroom activities as inclusive as possible (see “active learning,” above).

this lesson challenged students to uncover their understandings about who can and does do research, while at the same time allowing them to learn more about a research area that particularly interested them. students directly approached questions of bias and inclusion in stem, both through discussions and by reflecting on social aspects of their own education related to their interests in science and research. in their interviews, students asked researchers about their personal journeys and struggles, which uncovered elements of humanity in faculty and instructors that students might not otherwise have learned about.

student engagement was facilitated by instructors to ensure that students were able to contribute verbally (in discussions and think-pair-share activities), through writing (via quick writes), and in a variy of different roles (producing, giving feedback, revising) within their small groups. these activities were intended to ensure that all students were able to participate fully using their skills and strengths.

in accordance with the principles of inclusive teaching laid out by kimberly tanner (23), we employed a variy of low-stakes and collaborative teaching strategies to facilitate the group work. we were particularly careful to make sure that student-conceived norms for the classroom were applied and revisited throughout the course (22–24). this was especially important during discussions of inclusion, equity, and diversity, which introduced challenging descriptions of gender and racial bias that some students had not encountered in a classroom before.

because student choice and interest drive motivation and ownership (22, 25–27), students had a wide range of topics to explore (anything that fell under the flexible rubric of “natural science”, including both physical and life sciences). based on their scientific and research interests, students formed groups, which were different from previous groups that they had worked with. thus, within the classroom, the diversity of student interests and strengths became immediately clear to all participants. 

this lesson explicitly addresses the roles that identity plays in scientists’ lives and work. we used principles of inclusive teaching to ensure participation by all students at the same time that we explored how and why participation in science is still not universal (see “diversity in science” below). by providing students with choice, they also gained agency and self-efficacy in their own education and exploration.

group work is inherent to this lesson plan. we acknowledge that group work can be prohibitively difficult for students with extracurricular pressures and responsibilities such as work, commutes, and family. therefore, we recommend using smaller groups (3-4 students) rather than larger groups so that students within groups are bter able to find times to me outside of class. we also recommend forming groups with herogeneity in mind; groups should have students with different levels of previous experience and compency levels in regard to the subject matter (28). for students from underrepresented backgrounds and identities, we recommend that whenever possible, groups do not have only one representative from that underrepresented background to prevent feelings of isolation (29).

in order to make random call less threatening, we use a highly structured process following many of the principles outlined by waugh and andrews (9). students work on the question once on their own, then with a group so they have had time to think and discuss the question. we use inclusive language by asking about the process, not for the answer: “student x, what was your group discussing?” or “what were your group’s thoughts?” we frame random call on the first day of the course as being the start of a discussion, not an assessment of a particular student. students with extreme anxiy are able to opt-out of the random call list and we do not assign any credit for answering or not answering the call. 
in order to accurately refer to students we have a precourse survey in which we obtain each student’s preferred name and pronoun.
to support issues of identity and belonging in the classroom, we frequently use short, unscripted statements to reinforce all students’ rightful presence in the course and each students’ intrinsic value. we openly acknowledge that students frequently feel “imposter” syndrome and encourage them to seek study groups or help from staff.

to ensure that students feel welcomed, we establish classroom “iqute”, similar to that suggested by tanner 2013, where we emphasize that all students are expected to support one another and share their ideas in a judgement free manner (36). on the first day of class, we implemented an ice-breaker activity, called “catch the ball”, where all students and faculty “threw” around an imaginary ball to one another, and those who “caught” the ball on a turn introduced themselves, shared their interests, hobbies, and goals. we suggest a similar activity be implemented during the start of the course so that instructors can familiarize themselves with their students. to further create an inclusive learning environment, we ensure that all students have the means to be successful in the module. we ensure class material for the lesson is posted on blackboard and/or in google drive in a timely fashion so that students can access it prior to the start of class and afterwards. for students who may not have equal access to technology, we provide hard copies, as well as digital copies, of assignments and lab protocols. we also hold office hours on request and have discussion boards available so everybody can benefit from each other's questions and/or discussions. moreover, based on information obtained from class assessments (see above) and observations, students who have difficulties with any of the class content receive extra support and guidance as needed. thus, the module ensures equity and inclusivity by reaching all types of learners and ensuring students receive the support they need to succeed in the module.

student socioeconomic diversity was also considered throughout the design of this lesson. to prevent economic barriers, students are not required to purchase any textbooks or other supplementary materials to participate in this lesson. additionally, all assessment questions can be answered based on information provided on lecture slides and do not require outside resources. we also expose students to the work of under-acknowledged scientists. for example, we present the efforts of marjorie courtenay-latimer, who was one of few woman museum curators in the early 1900s, toward preserving a coelacanth specimen (supporting file s4. 6th mass extinction–class session i slides, slide 16) with the goal of highlighting scientific contributions made by individuals of varied backgrounds (13).

due to the inherent intertwining of human experiences with health- and environment-related topics in parasitology, there are ample opportunities in this kind of course for engaging students with activities that will allow them to reflect critically on the intersections of social equity, public health, and their own assumptions through a socio-scientific issues framework (21, 22). for example, the link bween hookworm infection, anemia, and impaired cognitive development is often illustrated in parasitology textbooks through the story of charles stiles’ 1902 announcement of the discovery of the “germ of laziness” in the american southeast and subsequent public health initiatives funded by john d. rockefeller (e.g., 2, page 360). while this narrative conveys real historical events and biology, the commonly used structure of the story tacitly reinforces harmful stereotypes about the populations that were affected. it also ignores important historical context where public messaging around this biological discovery was used to support and spread racist and classist ideologies in public health and popular culture (23). teaching such material can be made more inclusive by integrating an explicit discussion of the social context in which the scientific discoveries were made, and the role scientific information and subsequent interpration play in constructing both public policy and public narratives (see 21, 22).

additionally, the instructors serve as guides and research mentors rather than coming from a place as the absolute holders of knowledge and authority in the classroom. for example, students are empowered with the agency to make their own decisions about experiments, such as choosing which mutant strains to work with. because analyses of primary journal articles and student-generated data take place through small-group discussion, peer instruction is emphasized over instructor-led lectures.

by its nature, this course makes a mentored research experience accessible to all enrolled students and enables participation in scientific inquiry, which togher can help students develop a sense of belonging in science (13). all materials and resources for this course were provided by duquesne university, granting equal access to learning and experimental procedures regardless of the background or need of our students. adaptations to this protocol may be made to accommodate students with disabilities or students at an increased risk of infection from microorganisms. this course is taught under the context of microevolution and does not infringe on religious beliefs related to macroevolution. finally, by discussing how diversity provides source material upon which natural selection can act, the course content fosters appreciation for the value of existing diversity in a population for the overall fitness of that species.

student groups for the discussion were formed randomly and then ‘shuffled’, allowing communication among students who may not interact on a day-to-day basis. this has the effect of increasing within-group cognitive, cultural, gender and personal identity (or hidden identities) diversity. increasing diversity in groupwork can improve group-level problem-solving and individual learning (75–77). within each group, students were given specific times to share their knowledge and take notes on others’ contributions. ensuring that time was equally distributed among group members provides an opportunity for different ideas to emerge and for ensuring contributions from all students. inclusive group work has been shown to have positive effects on individual- and group-level learning (78, 79). this type of active learning is student-centered, a strategy believed to improve student learning as well as student attitudes and experiences regarding biology (74).",280,No,233,2019 - 2022

the web-based tools presented here are well suited for remote inclusive teaching because they do not require high-end or expensive computer systems, nor do they require high-speed intern. although microbiome datass can be quite large, students do not need to upload or download any large datass or files, as all file transfers are done virtually via the cyverse infrastructure connected to dna subway. similarly, all computational processes performed by dna subway are run virtually via the cyverse infrastructure, decreasing the dependence on reliable intern connectivity (once a job is started it runs regardless of whher one is connected to the intern or logged onto dna subway). it also eliminates the need for large memory or processing requirements of personal computers. in fact, the analysis performed by dna subway can be successfully compled using a smartphone with a web browser, which would allow students without a computer or intern access to comple this activity.

we also acknowledge the barriers that remain for many students and institutions relating to lack of adequate technology or intern connectivity, and that each college or university tackles such challenges differently. we also acknowledge that there is no single answer that will accommodate all students and institutions. for educators who may be interested in incorporating this activity with their students, but who are concerned about the lack of access to technology for their students, one possible alternative may be for the instructor to perform the dna subway and ranacapa analyses that their students recommend (based on initial discussion and hypothesis generation step) and print the resulting graphs and figures of each step performed along the way to show students the process. these hardcopies may then be disseminated to students, where they can follow the written tutorial and learn to interpr each of the graphs. in this way, students may still be engaged with the data analysis and graph interpration process, even if they did not go through the steps on a computer themselves. in this case, the learning outcomes would emphasize graph interpration and communication of results as opposed to the technical aspects of using the web tools.

the fate of corals in a warming world is a topic about which few students know much from their own experience or their prior academic work. however, once they begin learning about the ecosystem services of corals and the human dimensions of coral reef decline, almost all students find the issue compelling and urgent. students quickly grasp that the complexity of this work demands skills and perspectives from a broad range of disciplines. they also recognize that the diversity required to solve large global challenges encompasses not only scientific disciplines but also identities such as gender, hnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, personality, and approach to problem-solving (15). in each of the ares described here, students engage in making connections across ecological, organismal, physiological and cellular scales to address impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic threats to the ecosystem services of corals.

to create and empower inclusive research teams, instructors must be intentional about demonstrating the value of diversity in teamwork and must make the practice of collaborative work (including effective communication, conflict management, and consensus building) a key learning objective for the course (16). a core compency in the vision and change in undergraduate biology education report is the “ability to communicate and collaborate with other disciplines.” both faculty and students should be intentional and reflective about engaging in teamwork, first by making the collaborative process a valued component of each student’s individual efforts and second by implementing teaching approaches that support students in developing inclusive and equitable collaboration skills. an excellent resource for instructors wishing to cultivate inclusivity and equity in teamwork is available at the eberly center at carnegie mellon university. this resource offers suggestions for teaching approaches that support students as they form a team and work togher through a project (e.g., how to structure teamwork in a way that ensures interdependence among the students, how to create accountability of each individual while working in a team). valuing the collaborative process is key to cultivating inclusivity and equity because doing so allows students to see for themselves that complex problems require diverse skills, perspectives, and contributions.

when implementing cures, work should be scaffolded so that students can establish an initial base of knowledge and skills and then build upon that foundation as they engage in the research process. for this reason, we encourage instructors to start with the pla that introduces students to the sea system. while familiarizing students with background information about the sea system, instructors can use the simple laboratory activities embedded within the pla to help students develop and practice the skills they will need when they begin developing their own project ideas (e.g., culturing the symbiotic partners). further, by beginning with a broad introduction to the sea system, instructors scaffold subsequent work, allowing students to tackle problems that would otherwise be intractable. scaffolding is vital to an inclusive classroom as it provides instructors with a mhod for adapting their teaching to the individual needs of students (17).

students work togher in small groups multiple times during this lesson as it cultivates social learning and peer education. as small groups have been shown to support learning gains (17) and support students of various disciplines and levels (18,19), they are heavily utilized in my classes to create a more inclusive and inviting environment. the groups are intentionally assigned by the instructor to promote inclusivity and allow for students of varying achievement levels to collaborate and learn from one another. this lesson employs think-pair-share, which allows for more meaningful class discussions as students take the time to critically think about a topic and exchange ideas with classmates before whole class discussion. further, students write down their thoughts before class discussion, which eases anxiies for students who are uncomfortable with public speaking.

the use of technology is generally promoted in this course as assignments can be compled and submitted online, thus decreasing the environmental burdens associated with paper. however, as some students may not have a laptop or other classroom-friendly intern-connected device, instructors should print out a few copies of the assignments to accommodate all students. students can submit their final work by emailing the instructor a photo of their compled assignment.

in our experience, the activity appears to foster a sense of community among the students as they learn about each other's interests and have fun togher. however, giving the presentation can be intimidating for some students, especially those with anxiy or for whom english is a second language. for that reason, we structured the activity to support those students. when i (stockwell) give the ias directions on how to run the in-person version of the discussion section, i emphasize that they should l students present while sitting at their desks if they prefer. students also have their workshes in front of them and can read from them if they feel nervous about speaking spontaneously. the ia is in charge of projecting the students' slides so the students do not need to worry about the technology. the presentations are graded only on complion. with all those supports in place, the presentations represent a low-stakes way for students to practice the important skill of speaking in front of a group. if you have students with such severe anxiy that they cannot present even under these circumstances, you could offer them the opportunity to prerecord a presentation, as described in the online version of the activity.

access to a device that can take a photograph outside is a key component of this lesson. ideally, a mobile device (such as a smartphone or tabl with satellite connection) with the inaturalist application would be used. accounts are free to create on inaturalist. if mobile devices are prohibited or otherwise unavailable, observations may be made with digital cameras and uploaded through the inaturalist website. some colleges have cameras that can be loaned to the students, so it may be useful to check with departments whher these resources are available. the one important difference when using a digital camera to make observations is that students must record where they were when the photo was taken so that the observations can have associated geolocations (a process that is automatic with a mobile phone). a simplified data she can be created to encourage students to record this information while they are making observations (columns would include time of observation, photo file number, and location information). students could also be encouraged to me up with a partner for making the observations, which will reduce the burden for every student to have a device as well as promote collaboration and safy for work outside of class. instructors can submit their students' observations as a compiled effort to maintain student anonymity and fulfill the goal of contributing to a public biodiversity database.

schools may have restrictions on what applications and data students are allowed to share with respect to their coursework. if there are concerns, particularly about location sharing, there are some alternatives that allow students to participate without revealing identifying information. for example, the instructor might choose to create a single class inaturalist account with their email address; the account would then be controlled by the instructor, but all students would be granted access to contribute observations. instructors should monitor the account and change passwords if improper behavior is observed. more information on this adjustment can be found in the inaturalist teacher's guide (26).

if possible, we encourage students to create their own accounts on inaturalist so they may continue to be lifelong observers of nature and be more mindful of the natural world around them. instructors should make no assessment-related comments on student observations within the inaturalist platform, as that may be a violation of ferpa regulations. students will always have the option of deling their inaturalist accounts (and all of the data they created) after the lesson is comple, if they choose to do so.

utilizing data collected by local and global communities demonstrates to students the scale and scope of who participates and contributes to scientific data. reciprocally, the students' efforts to record their observations extends beyond the classroom and into the broader community that can learn from and use their data for other projects. this activity also illustrates cultural diversity across neighborhoods, as different communities may support or cultivate different habitat types or species that influence the local diversity. students collect independent data where they are or want to go; thus, the data represents the local areas and communities that students identify most with, rather than just the typical parks or recreation areas. overall, the students are provided the opportunity to experience how science is accomplished through diverse participants and how through their contributions of observations, they become a part of that community of scientists.

group work was also structured to support the success of all students centering around the principles of positive interdependence, individual accountability, and equal and simultaneous interaction (29). students were individually accountable by compling their own individual assignments that prepared them for a class session or as they learned new skills during class. being individually accountable at every stage of the research process prepared students to participate equally and productively during group interactions. group work relied on positive interdependence, as students needed each other both for the overall success of the project as well as for tasks that were complicated enough to elicit mutual need (29-31). specifically, students worked in groups of four for cognitively difficult tasks that benefit from multiple inputs such as planning the experiment or discussing experimental results. for performing the experiment or recording the results, students worked in smaller groups of two to allow both students to be fully engaged. for example, often both students worked on the experiment togher, while in other cases the two students had specific, complementary tasks of either compling or recording results. successful group interactions in this lesson were also supported by clear goals, tasks being highly relevant to the goal, and outcomes in the form of lab reports or presentations with multiple parts that clearly linked to future value in their science careers (31). active learning in general has been shown to support inclusive learning by all students (32). cures implemented early in the curriculum have been shown to improve scientific self-efficacy, identity, and student persistence in stem degrees among diverse students (11,33) and hold particular promise for underrepresented minority students (33-35).

when creating lab discussion breakout groups, some instructors created groups to ensure that there were no gender imbalances or, for example, one student from a traditionally under-represented background being the only under-represented student in their group. some instructors randomly assigned groups each week, providing opportunities for students to me more peers and be exposed to more diverse ways of thinking and working. further, assigning roles to different group members each week ensured that all students had opportunities to speak, report, and be heard by their peers.

additionally, the activity allows students to bring their cultural experiences into the classroom and share them with their classmates. for example, students are encouraged to bring in foods that are culturally relevant to them. this shows students the importance of representative sampling in experimental designs. by giving students freedom, the activity encourages them to challenge dominant narratives in science. for example, students from non-western backgrounds may identify variables or design flaws that westernized science might miss. this could generate a class discussion after the activity about the relationship bween experimental design, diversity, westernization, and drawing conclusions.",458,Yes,185,2019 - 2022

in addition, as the instructor, it is important that you recognize the diversity in your classroom. your class’s diversity may include some of the following differences: race, class, poverty, gender, disability, and privilege or disenfranchisement (29). before asking students to introduce themselves and identify diversity issues important to them you, as their instructor, can provide a comfortable classroom environment by introducing yourself to the class. describe your background and diversity issues you deem important to create an inclusive classroom environment. you might also include a diversity statement in your syllabus.

once you have initiated the discussion on diversity encourage your students to introduce themselves to the class at the beginning of the semester. give them a chance to say who they are and what they hope to gain and give to the class. in addition, students should be encouraged to speak to you privately to assess their learning, progress, and concerns for the class. you should also ask them, during an office meing, about their learning style, do they work best alone, or in a group. do they excel at oral or written work? l them know that you are available to me with them in person, during office hours, or by email correspondence. tell them that the class will provide an opportunity for them to participate and excel in different ways and that you want them to tell you if they are uncomfortable, for any reason, during class and what things you as the instructor can do to facilitate their learning. in short, they matter to you as individuals.

students work in groups of 2-4. this establishes a small community of learners in which each student can feel safe and included. i assign members to each group based on my prior knowledge of their prior research experience and observation of their engagement with their major. some students have extensive out of class research experience, and these students should not group togher. if students self-select the groups become homogenous and therefore do not reflect the diversity of the classroom.

as an example of an inclusive learning environment during lab 3 and 4, students examine each other's work and then decide togher which of their soil isolates most closely resembles a streptomyces bacterium.  these groups prepare a short in-lab presentation that gives each student a voice. it allows students who might be reluctant to speak to the entire class by themselves, to be part of a supportive group presentation that represents their work. this allows students with different learning styles (interactive group work as opposed to individual noninteractive work) to benefit from an interactive learning environment. this opportunity arises several times during the semester when students present their hypotheses regarding their group’s laboratory work and their data. this lesson also employs peer instruction which promotes an inclusive environment as each student brings different skills to the group and therefore adds value to each person’s contribution.

finally, as the instructor, you should take time to point out the diversity among streptomyces investigators. hopwood’s streptomyces in nature and medicine (8) provides an excellent resource documenting this point and the power of cooperative scientific investigation. i cannot emphasize enough how useful and important hopwood’s book is, as a resource, and to impress upon students the diversity inherent in the international streptomyces project. the text highlights the international cooperation, among female and male scientists of different nationalities, brought togher at the john innes centre in england. individual investigators are described and given credit for their contributions. the book demonstrates the power of both diversity and cooperative investigation. i point out to students the names of individuals who contributed to the international streptomyces project. for example, hee-jeon hong from korea working with mark buttner, from the john innes center in norwich uk, discover one pathway for resistance to the antibiotic vancomycin (8, 30) and jan westpheling working with xianyang ni, from the university of georgia in athens, georgia who togher examine the promoter region of the streptomyces chitinase gene (8, 15). these are not household names, but they are known in streptomyces biology and demonstrate to students the diversity and collaborative nature of scientific investigation. there are many more examples and i strongly encourage you to obtain a copy of this book.

we also use place-based examples to illustrate some of the seafood traceability issues. overall, the issue of seafood sustainability is already economically relevant to the state of rhode island where marine-based industries form a large sector of the economy. using images of local restaurants and other stakeholders in the presentation slides increased the place-based nature of the lesson plan. similarly, basing the seafood watch activity off a menu from a local seafood restaurant enhanced the authenticity of the activity. accordingly, we encourage instructors to locate a menu from a local seafood restaurant for their own classes. some student populations may be significantly less connected to seafood for cultural and/or geographic reasons. in this case, the best approach for connecting to these students may be through the use of fast food examples. many popular fast food chains have seafood items on the menu, with varying levels of disclosure regarding from where they are sourced (e.g., imported shrimp vs. alaskan pollock vs. north pacific cod). instructors could modify the seafood watch activity such that students are asked to compare seafood options from multiple fast food chains.

an added benefit of the formats we selected is that they are designed to foster a sense of collaboration among students. in the activities, students have discussions to select experimental design strategies used by the entire class section, pool data to explore sample size's effect on variation, and create pictorial and quantitative expression in groups, in class, with instructor feedback and discussion. all of these activities are designed with collaboration and consensus building in mind. strategies to increase cooperation and decrease compition, like the ones used in these activities, tend to increase student achievement and feelings of engagement (18,19). this is especially important in a lab sting, where traditional lab formats may create a sense of compition among students trying to comple a prescribed experiment in parallel to other students. in addition, recent evidence has shown that collaborative lab activities help eliminate achievement gaps based on previous science experience and science career interest, which can vary widely among introductory undergraduate students for whom these activities are designed (20).",299,Yes,154,2019 - 2022

when sting up experimental design and working groups, instructors must keep in mind time constraints, transportation needs, and mobility limitations that might affect students. for group projects, an important challenge is scheduling time outside of class when all members of the group are available. field work, which must be amenable to a variy of factors including weather conditions, further complicates this effort. for this reason, i s aside dedicated class time for field data collection. when groups collected data at off-campus sites, we organized carpools to ensure everyone had a ride. for most of my students, mobility was not a limitation for walking transects. also, some of our sites were wheel-chair accessible. however, as mentioned earlier walking transects is only one mhod of sampling. spot-sampling, where the group remains in one place and records birds over a s period, is another option.

in situations where students cannot participate in group fieldwork, alternative plans should be developed. for example, one of my students was on maternity leave during the field work portion of the cure project. instead of joining an assigned group, she collected her own data on residential birds in her neighborhood. she then rejoined the class for data analysis, group discussion, and the final reports at the end of the semester. many approaches can be taken to implementing this module. in the interests of inclusion, it is important to remain flexible and avoid a one-size-fits-all minds.

additionally, educational research has shown that applied laboratory experiences increase interest in science by traditionally underrepresented populations in the sciences by demonstrating the relevance of the course material (11). in particular, including content related to social justice issues such as health disparities has been shown to increase minority engagement and persistence (52), which may be one of the many reasons the aaas encourages courses to connect science to sociy more directly (12). this lesson has very overt relevance and highlights the importance of considering developmental biology in discussions about environmental issues when students observe the impact of pesticide exposure on organogenesis (followed by more focused and personally-relevant experiments in the independent experiment portion). it also has the opportunity to be connected to issues of social justice around access to quality water and the link bween this access and public health outcomes. readings from the 2010 book, living downstream: an ecologist's personal investigation of cancer and the environment (53) or scenes from the documentary based on this book, could be a way to stimulate conversation about this connection. this cure reinforces the value of a course project and demonstrates how coursework can be connected to broader issues students may care about. in fact, cures are recommended as a mechanism for making scientific research more inclusive because they grant access to meaningful research experiences for all students (16). while some particularly recommend establishing cure programs at minority serving institutions (54), establishing cures at any undergraduate institution has the potential to enhance the interest and persistence of students from underrepresented groups in stem fields.",328,No,150,2019 - 2022

Squirrels in Space: Using Radio Telemetry to Explore the Space Use and Movement of Sciurid Rodents,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.25,Lesson,2020,Ecology,"Dispersal, Habitat selection, Home range, Squirrel-Net",Yes,"squirrel-n modules are designed to act as cures that allow all students an authentic research experience in class, thereby overcoming the time and financial limitations that prevent many students from engaging in research outside of class (21). such equal access to research experiences may help women and minorities overcome the structural barriers that reduce their numbers in the sciences (22). participation in a cure has been linked to student gains in research skills, self-efficacy, and persistence in science (23-25). additionally, our cure modules are implemented through a national nwork that not only creates broad-scale datass, but will also help students feel a sense of belonging to a scientific community outside their class, as well as validation for contributions to this broader community (26).

in this specific lesson, a variy of strategies, such as think-pair-share, multiple hands, multiple voices (i.e., requiring multiple raised hands or responses to a question before any responses are shared), and whip around are used to foster participation of all students in discussion activities (20). while inclusive instruction is somimes difficult in field sciences, this lesson provides ample opportunity for including students with disabilities. because sciurids are broadly distributed across diverse natural and urban habitats and are present on nearly all university and college campuses in north america (27) this lesson can be implemented in locations that allow participation of students with mobility disabilities. additionally, because data collection requires both listening to radio telemry receivers and visually locating sciurids or their sign (i.e., nests, burrows), collaboration of students in small groups allows participation of students with either visual or hearing impairments during field activities. this lesson can also provide flexibility in how activities are conducted outside of class. as an extension option, students sign-up to track radio-collared sciurids outside of class by choosing times that fit their schedules, thereby avoiding timing conflicts with work or family obligations.

depending on how the instructor implements this activity, there are numerous opportunities for active learning techniques such as multiple-hands, multiple-voices, think-pair-share, and whip arounds, each of which provide a less-intimidating opportunity for all students to contribute their voice to the discussion (22). we have also used jigsaw to dissect primary literature articles (e.g., 4-9) related to the activity. this can be done separately in a 50-minute lecture period or a shorter version can be incorporated into the first lab instead of the prompt we recommend in the lesson plan. finelli  al.

this computer-based lesson gives classes/courses who are unable to go into the field because of geographic, budgary, medical/health, time, or seasonal/weather constraints the opportunity to collect meaningful ecological data.

emphasis on visuals

images and videos are powerful tools for engaging student interest. however, the visual nature of the lesson does place unfortunate limitations on the value for students with visual impairments. many image analysis tasks done manually require careful mouse-work to delineate shapes or lengths on a screen. thus, as written, the lesson is not well-suited for students with visual impairments.

there are modifications that could improve accessibility and benefit all students by providing other ways of encoding and interpring visual information. by its nature, image analysis turns visual information into quantitative information - numerical measurements of lengths, areas, color intensities, c. providing numerical mrics of visual properties of biological specimens could help students with visual impairments experience specimens (via screen readers, sonification systems, c.) that would otherwise be unavailable, and may benefit all students by providing multiple ways of representing or encoding the information.

interestingly, image analysis is often automated to improve speed, accuracy, and repeatability (15). a lesson that focused on image analysis automation could teach valuable real-world skills and open up participation to more students (e.g., students in computer science courses).

group work

group work, when managed well by the instructor, can provide an environment where the diverse asss of students yield a bter product than any individual student could have created themselves. facilitating productive collaboration can be challenging, though, and requires active strategies of the instructor. below are some approaches we have used successfully. we encourage instructors to choose strategies they believe will be effective to ensure equal and active participation among their students (see 16-17 for more ideas).

gather ideas from all group members

when groups need to pick a research question, some students will be more willing to share initial ideas than others. give students time to think about and make a list of possible research questions before they form groups. once they are in groups, ask students to exchange lists and read each other's ideas aloud.

have students work individually first

although students work on most of this lab in groups, they comple the regression assignment (supporting file s9. leaf-cutter ants – regression practice she) individually. providing time for students to think through and write out their answers before discussing with group members helps students clarify what they understand and what they have questions about.

diversify group skillss

we find that when groups are herogeneous with regards to excel proficiency, they tend to troubleshoot technical issues internally instead of waiting for help from the instructor. this is desirable, as it encourages students to help each other and builds community.

make group members accountable to each other (and to you!)

two goals of this activity are to help all students become more comfortable creating scatterplots and performing linear regressions. these goals cannot be accomplished if one group member makes the scatterplot or runs the analysis while the other(s) sit passively. tell students you expect them to actively contribute to every component of the module. for example, if one student is creating a scatterplot, their group members should be reviewing online tutorials or proofreading the graph. one strategy to keep group members accountable is to require students to write and turn in a log of the specific tasks they comple. group members should review and sign one another's logs before submission. another strategy is to require students to comple anonymous peer evaluations at the end of each lab.

the development and presentation of a comic encourages students to use visual communication rather than rely on words alone to clearly communicate science. visual communication is an important strategy to engage the bilingual deaf community in science (19). visual communication is also useful for students who are english language learners and for students with disabilities.

additionally, scientific information is often inaccessible due to journal pay walls and unfamiliar scientific jargon. comics told in everyday language with compelling illustrations make science accessible and relevant to a larger audience.

the class sessions in which this lesson takes place, are designed to promote participation of all students in several ways. first, a student response system (kahoot!) was used to ask where students placed the safe operating space for humanity prior to reading the paper (supporting file s2. perceptions and cooperative learning – reading assurance assignment and in-class polling questions). students answered this question using personal accounts that were established at the beginning of the semester to facilitate in-class participation during all class sessions. responses are then made visible to the entire class and used to frame instructions for the in-class group assignment. this question is used to give instructors a sense of the variability in responses that students will be discussing and serves as a transition bween a short introductory lecture and the collaborative group activity. the instructor and teaching assistants circulate among the groups to ensure that discussion time is equally shared. timing prompts can also be given to ensure each member of the group has an equal time to share their predictions prior to compiling group results and discussing the paper. in addition, we recommend that the instructor require each group to appoint a student to be a discussion moderator to ensure equal participation of all group members; this is particularly critical in large-enrollment courses in which instructor access to each group is limited by seat arrangement. to comple guided discussion questions (supporting file s5. perceptions and cooperative learning – discussion and assessment questions), we suggest first having students perform a think-pair-share and then reconvene as a 4-member group to develop answers to each question. the instructor can then call on groups randomly and/or call on specific groups that arrive at particular answers to each question for the full class discussion. having students comple both formative assessments through use of the guided discussion questions and summative assessments (supporting file s5. perceptions and cooperative learning – discussion and assessment questions) encourages students to engage with their peers and the material both in and out of class.

this activity will leverage diversity within the classroom by encouraging every student to provide their perspective on how the molecules are structured and how they are changing. in particular, the color-coded chenille stems that are described here are highly adaptable for differently-abled students, including varying color combinations for dichromats and trichromats, or using differently-textured stems for visually-impaired students. these activities have been successfully integrated with professional online animations that are expertly narrated, and multiple problem ss allow study and practice at multiple learning paces.

as the promotion of diversity and inclusion within many institutions in the united states has become increasingly paramount, many organizations and social entities are encouraged to adopt standards or policies that celebrate the diversity of their members while also fostering inclusive environments in which all members feel like part of a cohesive team. such diversity and inclusion standards can be established for professional sociies, degree programs, and even anatomy and physiology classes (70). for example, in this particular module, instructors have the opportunity to discuss occupational diversity (70) in the context of an anatomy and physiology course. students in the course will ultimately decide to pursue different occupations/career paths which in turn can influence the level of interest a student may have in a particular topic covered in the course. the interested students can then help to motivate other students based on their enthusiasm and excitement for the topic. this module should particularly appeal to those students interested in occupational therapy, physical therapy, or exercise science since many of the concepts regarding kinesiology and biomechanics are highly relevant to these fields. instructors could offer at the beginning of the lesson a quick explanation of why the lab module concepts are pertinent to these particular students and/or fields of study. even if there are no students in the course who intend to become occupational or physical therapists, instructors can discuss how the content pertaining to skelal muscle anatomy would also be revisited in greater dail in medical, dental, nurse anesthesia, physician assistant, or other anatomy-relevant curricula. moreover, exposure to this content and its career correlations may allow students an opportunity to consider such relevant fields as professional options. such exposure is especially important for under-represented populations including women, trans or gender non-conforming, or other underrepresented minority students since it might encourage these individuals to help diversify fields in which there is a paucity of members of their respective groups. for instance, physical therapy is a field often predominated by caucasian men while occupational therapy is a field often predominated by caucasian women; exposure to fields other than the stereotypical norms can help educate underrepresented students about a more diverse array of options to help them make the best decisions for themselves. on the other hand, some students might not intend to pursue any health-related careers. nevertheless, instructors could discuss the relevancy of the concepts such as mabolism, homeostasis, maximal oxygen consumption, and anaerobic capacity to an understanding of basic health during physical exercise.

since students are engaged in physical exercises during the lab module, instructors have the opportunity to emphasize the importance of physical exercise, in general, in people's daily lives. for instructors teaching in states that have higher healthcare disparities than normal, providing statistics from the national center for health statistics (nchs) regarding the state of health of their citizens (71) can be a powerful learning experience for providing awareness to students. (international readers can refer to their respective health institutions for similar data.) such awareness can motivate students then to be advocates for healthier lifestyles among their colleagues, friends, families, and community members. this advocacy is also important even in states or regions that are predominated by healthy individuals because there may be some subss of the population which lack healthy lifestyles due to a number of factors that can include limited access to healthy foods, lower socioeconomic status, reduced health literacy, or other social derminants of health (72,73). by creating an atmosphere of comradery around physical activity as a critical strategy for reducing health disparities and supporting healthy living (74,75), instructors can invite students into a learning community that is inclusive while also diverse. for example, instructors can support an atmosphere of comradery in this lab module by allowing the groups to challenge one another to see which group is the fittest. alternatively, instructors could display on the walls posters that convey helpful tips for students to incorporate at least thirty minutes of exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, biking, c.) into their daily routines and could provide encouraging and motivating words to stay healthy. additionally, instructors could provide opportunities for students to create groups to support healthy lifestyles and hang photos of individuals of diverse backgrounds engaged in physical activities. instructors can also provide encouraging words and highlight helpful tips during the exercise physiology component of the lab.

instructors might also teach classes of anatomy and physiology in which students might have disabilities or injuries that prevent them from engaging in the exercise physiology lab activities. students with disabilities provide another enriching opportunity for incorporating experiential diversity (70,76,77) into the class and creating a more inclusive environment. instructors can make a number of decisions to accommodate students with disabilities or injuries. instructors can simply allow such students to abstain from physical activity and work in close proximity with a partner within their lab group or perhaps even serve as the scribe for their lab group if they are able. if the students have the ability to perform alternative exercises (e.g., manually propelling their wheelchairs with their arms), instructors could also provide such students with the option of engaging in the lab activities under modified circumstances. either way, instructors would consider the freedom of choice and the comfort of the students in this decision. students who chose to abstain could be placed into a think-pair-share group with their assigned partner within their lab group. in a think-pair-share sequence, the students would have an opportunity to think or write about and discuss the biological concepts being explored in the lab activities (78,79). for instance, in this lab module, if there are students using wheelchairs, crutches, or some other assistive device for mobility, these students can be prompted to explain to their lab group partners how the same concepts of exhaustion and muscle fatigue can apply to situations in which they are rapidly rotating the wheels of their chair or moving their crutches with their arms, perhaps to rush somewhere quickly. in the communication exchange, students without disabilities could gain insights into the experiences of someone who cannot perform tasks that involve physical exertion, like pedaling on the stationary bicycle during the wingate test or running on the treadmill during the maximal oxygen consumption experiment, while also sharing their experiences as they perform the wingate test and running experiments. in this example, the students with disabilities are provided an equitable opportunity to engage in the lab activities by alternative means since they cannot perform the experiments in the same way that other students can, but they are also included in the conversation and learning experiences with the other students.

instructors might even choose to adopt a think-pair-share policy for all students in the class to promote further inclusion and equity (79). dr. kimberly d. tanner also provides a self-assessment of equitable teaching strategies in her article on promoting student engagement and cultivating classroom equity (79), so instructors might want to consult this tool when evaluating the inclusive nature of their own classroom. while this article addresses classroom teaching practices as a whole, many of these strategies can be incorporated into this lab module in addition to the think-pair-share technique. because the students will already be actively participating in groups, instructors might consider ambulating the room and attending to each group periodically to ensure that all students are participating either in the activities or in discussion concerning the activities and that all students are provided fair access to learning, thinking, and teaching.

A Lesson on Matter and Energy at the Organismal Scale: Linking Patterns and Processes Across Diverse Taxa,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.42,Lesson,2020,Introduction Biology,"plants, energy, Animals, fungi, matter, organismal scale",Yes,"the course in which this lesson took place was centered on inclusive and equitable teaching practices. many approaches were implemented to make the course more personal, structured, and engaging, in line with recommendations for building an inclusive environment suitable for all learners (21).

the design and delivery of curricular materials was based on evidence about student reasoning, and the impact of diverse backgrounds and prior experiences on learning. all classes incorporated collaborative group work conducted in small, permanent groups (3-4 students). the groups were engineered to be diverse in terms of students' prior coursework, majors, and demographic variables. diverse groups were generated using the ""create_groups"" function in the r package 'mindiff' v. 0.01-3 (22). this function assigns students to n groups by minimizing (via 10,000 repitions) the differences among groups for one or multiple criteria (e.g., prior biology courses, plan, demographic variables). the result is a s of group assignments in which students are herogenous within groups and homogeneous among groups.

each group was assigned to work with a ugta who was responsible for formally documenting group progress and trying to understand thinking in order to foster learning. each ugta oversaw a maximum of 35 students. ugtas were responsible for knowing students' names and seating locations and were able to identify when groups were in need of assistance. ugtas were utilized to help the instructor gauge student engagement and identify topics that were difficult for students. ugtas wore name tags and students were provided with name tents. the instructor made efforts to call students by their names in every class, both during small group conversations and during class-wide discussions. the instructor also used transparent and low-stakes ""cold calling"" to encourage engagement during activities and to foster the contribution of diverse student voices.

to appropriately prepare ugtas for their important roles, they participated in 4.5 hours of workshops throughout the semester (focusing on cognition, engagement, and diversity) that sought to encourage inclusive teaching practices and a growth minds. ugtas were also prepared weekly with information about the upcoming activities, content, and learning difficulties they could expect to encounter.

i would recommend that students form their own discussion groups, just as they would if the experiment was conducted in person. this will provide a sense of familiarity and comfort, which is likely to be appreciated given the fact that the experiment is being carried out virtually.

in addition, when designing videos for the prelab lectures, the instructor should keep in mind that they should provide notes, audio, as well as video to accommodate students with disabilities. i also recommend following up individually with students to ensure that the material has been presented suitably.

lastly, the instructor needs to make sure that the individualized feedback that the students receive on both of the formative assessments is thoughtful, constructive, and well-explained. because the students do not have traditional face-to-face time, they will rely on this feedback to prepare their lab reports. in addition, the instructor should be open to suggestions or modifications from the students given the unconventional way of compling this experiment.

(if you are concerned about insufficient sampling, you could supplement your class data with supporting file s8. mapping a mutation – sample final datas) during the week 1 and 3 procedures (supporting file s2. mapping a mutation – fly lab manual), we encourage students to discuss anomalous/interesting observations rather than just assume that they are ""wrong"" and change their individual data to match group consensus.
encouraging student initiative: we allot class-time during week 1 for students to work ahead on the week 3 prelaboratory assignment, asking questions as needed. similarly, if time is available the week before the week 1 class, instructors may wish to allot time for students to work ahead on the week 1 prelaboratory assignment.
welcoming a diversity of working styles: during our ""study hall"" style office hours bween weeks 4 and 5 (table 1), we make every effort to accommodate different working styles: we reserve a large room with wireless access and chair arrangements that allow for small group or solitary work, we encourage students to collaborate if they wish, and they may work nearby if they prefer a quier/less-crowded location. at least one instructor and one ta are available for questions throughout all study halls. if students cannot or would rather not attend these study halls, we are happy to me with them at another time.

What do Bone and Silly Putty® have in Common?: A Lesson on Bone Viscoelasticity,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2019.12,Lesson,2019,Anatomy-Physiology,"structure-function, injury, Anisotropy, Hysteresis, Skeletal System, Viscoelasticity",Yes,"this lesson includes several visual elements, focusing primarily on a graphical analysis of the projected stress-strain curve and on the real-time manipulation of silly putty®. this manipulation also incorporates a kinesthic aspect to the lesson, especially for those students who have the chance to handle the putty. thus, this lesson may bter attract the attention of students who preferentially approach learning through visual-spatial or bodily-kinesthic means (4), as opposed to primarily through the morraditional verbal-linguistic or logical-mathematical means.

this real-world experiential demonstration may also appeal more to students who might be located within the ""converger"" realm of david kolb's learning styles, as laid out in his 1984 treatise on experiential learning (5). such students fall closer to the ""active experimentation"" end on the processing dimension and the ""abstract conceptualization"" end on the perception dimension (5), giving them some of the qualities associated with engineers, whose work involves iterative modes of thinking conceptually and then instantiating and executing ideas in the real world to see if their ideas work in practice. those students who do have the opportunity actually to handle the silly putty® material may be able to approach the lesson from the learning perspectives of either a ""pragmatist""--putting abstract concepts into real-world practice--and/or a ""reflector""--observing and then subsequently thinking about activities (6).

though the students themselves, in a large lecture classroom, cannot all have the concre tactile experience of directly handling the silly putty®, they are all in fact able to watch it being handled. such observation can engage the mirror neuron system, which is thought to be essential for learning by imitation (for a review of this system, see reference 7). thus, the demonstration has the potential for also possibly tapping into other sensory modalities (e.g., touch), or cortically-mirrored motor planning to enrich the student experience of the lesson.

while the practice of specifically modifying teaching mhodologies to match preferred student learning styles has come under recent scrutiny and skepticism (8,9), engaging students of different academic backgrounds and life experiences remains nevertheless as important as it is challenging, particularly when discussing dense material such as this. therefore, framing the lesson within the context of athlics, and using familiar objects, can render the lesson less intimidating and make the content more universally accessible. we designed this activity so it may facilitate meaningful connections for the students, perhaps even including personal ones. building such connections may result in improvements to the affective domain (10) of students' relationships to and perceptions or understanding of the coursework. reciprocally, improvements in the affective domain have the potential to positively impact students' attitudes towards and personal attachment to stem material. being able to draw links bween the course material and everyday-life applications helps students--especially from underrepresented minority groups--develop a greater sense of belonging in stem fields (11), and thus enhances their experience in the classroom and the course, which may additionally have the beneficial effect of aiding in student rention.

to increase the sense that a scientist identity is achievable by our students, we explicitly connect macognitive processes that are critical for science (listed in table 1) to the laboratory and macognitive module activities that the students engage in. moreover, the opportunity to engage in a true scientific struggle allows students to reframe difficult moments in science as a natural part of doing real science rather than a referendum on their own potential as scientists, potentially increasing student development of a growth minds towards science. in our implementation of this module as a trahymena-focused research project, we were also able to introduce relevant preliminary data that had been obtained by another undergraduate student researcher (21). in sum, students can make the connection that research can be difficult, that previous research can be improved upon, and that they can be the ones to improve upon it.

the structure of this module requires the equal participation of all students, with evidence of their involvement collected in the form of various assessments, including workshes and participation in class discussions. students are given time to process concepts and organize their own thoughts through take-home work or in small-group explorations before being asked to report out to the class or to comple hands-on laboratory activities. this provides students with the opportunity to fully participate in and bolster their confidence for in-class work. the macognitive prompts and assigned homework are designed to be inclusive of diverse points of view, allowing for a variy of possible answers (see supporting files s8-s10). finally, we emphasize the importance and strength of a diverse community to making scientific progress in our module. student pairs must draw on each other's strengths to accomplish several distinct tasks, from collecting information in silico to execution of laboratory protocols to reflecting on their experiences and decision-making.",443,No,99,2019 - 2022

another way to improve group work and promote inclusion is to provide instruction on effective group work practices at the beginning of the project. this is especially important if you plan to assign a group presentation, poster, or writing assignment related to this project. we have developed a class session on effective group work and planning that can be used with these modules (supporting file s5: working in groups - lecture slides). finally, time is provided during lab classes to comple much of the group work related to this project (e.g., planning, data analysis), in order to be inclusive for students with obligations outside of class, such as work or family commitments.

there is diversity in the prevalence of the different actn3 genotypes throughout various populations, genders, and races (10,12-15), and students should observe this diversity when they conduct their literature reviews. students are able to work collaboratively in their groups to conduct literature searches. furthermore, classroom collaboration occurs during the development of the synthesis matrix and the overall project, when students have the opportunity to demonstrate their diversity of opinions and engage in productive discussions that ultimately result in the best experimental design.

lastly, the phenotypic modules, which involve measurement of muscle phenotypes in each student, are applicable to individuals of varying physical capabilities, but are also made voluntary. on average, biological males have higher muscle mass than biological females, and it is therefore important to stratify results by biological sex during analysis of data. in order to account for transgender, non-binary, or other individuals who are uncomfortable disclosing biological sex, an option to not disclose biological sex is included on the demographic information form (supporting file s10: demographic information form). collate this information in a manner that keeps it private. while participation in the physical activity and disclosure of biological sex is voluntary, analysis of anonymous results and data is required. we have found that the majority of students opt to participate in the experiments and disclose biological sex.

we also used examples that are economically relevant to the state of maine throughout the lesson, and observed that students became more engaged when the discussion included an organism important to their community. for example, when students with experience in the timber industry were shown predicted changes in tree species community structure that correlated with an increase in global temperature, they commented on the potential economic disadvantages to their area. students living in the potato farming region of the state commented on the specifics of how fertilizers are used and the effects these chemicals have on their community over time. finally, at a campus near the coast, students connected the lesson to research on sugar kelp that was being conducted in their department.

although the examples in this lesson focused on maine industries, we encourage instructors to modify the lesson to connect it to economically relevant photosynthic organisms in their own area. we used organisms that are grown in a variy of ways with both terrestrial (potato and timber) and aquatic (sugar kelp) examples to provide a variy of contexts in which students could apply photosynthic concepts. to extend this work into other regions, instructors can consult data about local crop production (e.g. https://www.nass.usda.gov/charts_and_maps/; https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/), guides focused on aquatic photosynthic organisms (e.g. https://aquaplant.tamu.edu/plant-identification/; http://www.algaebase.org/), and information about farming in the ocean (e.g. https://ideas.ted.com/vertical-ocean-farms-that-can-feed-us-and-help-our-seas/; https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/08/22/542903378/scientists-hope-to-farm-the-biofuel-of-the-futurein-the-pacific-ocean; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00100/full).

engaging community college students in research has been shown to benefit students in a variy of ways, including their transfer to four-year stem programs, and several research programs targing community college students are successfully implemented (31,32). despite the focus on compency-based and experiential learning in higher education, it is still relatively uncommon for community college students to conduct primary, original research on the large scale that this lesson provides. according to data from the american association of community colleges in 2012, an estimated 12.8 million students enrolled at a community college, accounting for 45% of all undergraduates in the united states. 56% of stem undergraduate students attended a community college at some point of their studies (31). these large enrollment numbers underscore the increasing impact that community colleges are having on the undergraduate education of in the united states. community college students vary greatly in age and other demographic variables such as income and hnicity. according to the american association of community colleges, the average age of the community college student population is 28 with approximately 36% enrolled as first-generation college students (33). moreover, 36% of community college students receive pell grants. in 2015, at century college, approximately 55% of the students at the community college were first generation college students with little or no previous exposure to science courses (34).

while the lesson is inherently inclusive, there are also variies of specific activities that will accommodate the needs of students with diverse learning styles. from development of the group hypotheses to analysis of results, the laboratory lesson is collaborative, ""easing the way"" to scientific experimentation for students. students learn how to balance an 'ideal' experimental design with feasibility, specifically of obtaining soil samples from locations to which students have access. discussion throughout the laboratory lesson emphasizes the prevalence and timely importance of spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment as it relates to the greater community. in addition, pedagogical approaches implemented in this laboratory lesson accommodate a variy of learning styles through the use of demonstrations, videos, hands on lab activities, mini-lectures, workshes, and case studies.

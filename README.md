 My name is Sokona Mangane. As a Student Advisor and Researcher for the Racially Just, Inclusive, and Open STEM Education [(RIOS) Institute](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/rios), I'm conducting a 
 computational text anlaysis of STEM Open Education Resources (OER), specifically on the website [CourseSource](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/coursesource/). See my most updated work [here](https://github.com/smsokona/RIOS-Research/blob/master/TextAnalysisEDA.html)!

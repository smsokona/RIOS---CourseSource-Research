## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading data}
#install.packages("skimr")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
rios_data <- read_csv("RIOS Research - Course Source - Sheet1 2.csv")
rios_data$`Inclusive Teaching  included?`[12] = "No"

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

diversity_related <- c("diversity", "bias", "confirmation bias", "cognitive bias", "social justice", "broader impacts", "racism", "identity", "equity", "inclusivity", "environmental justice", "inclusion", "belonging")

#rios_data %>% 
 # filter(`keyword themes` %in% diversity_related)



```

```{r}
#word count over time plot 
#rios_data %>%
 # ggplot(aes(rios_data$Year, rios_data$`Word Count of Inclusive Teaching?`)) + 
  #  geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) +
   # labs(x = "Year", y = "Word count of Inclusive Teaching Section",
  #title = "Word Count of Inlcusive Teaching Sections Over Time")


  boxplot(`Word Count of Inclusive Teaching?`~Year,
          data=rios_data,
          main="Word Count of Inlcusive Teaching Sections Over Time",
          xlab="Year",
          ylab="Word count of Inclusive Teaching Section",
          horizontal = TRUE)



```




```{r}
test <- "chiasma formation"

rios_data$`keyword themes`[2] %in% test


```
